JhuZdtLoggerModule
==================

A ZF2 module to log data using [Zend\Log](http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.1/en/modules/zend.log.overview.html) and write them to [ZendDeveloperTools](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendDeveloperTools) toolbar.
___

Installation
============

The easiest way is by using [composer](http://getcomposer.org). Just add `"jhuet/zdt-logger-module": "dev-master"` (or `"jhuet/zdt-logger-module": "0.1"` for last stable version) as a requirement in your `composer.json` file and it will be automatically downloaded next time you do `composer.phar update`.

If you don't use composer, drop the files of [this archive](https://github.com/jhuet/JhuZdtLoggerModule/archive/master.zip) ([0.1 here](https://github.com/jhuet/JhuZdtLoggerModule/archive/0.1.zip)) in your `module` directory.

Then, add `Jhu\ZdtLoggerModule` in the list of activated modules of your `application.config.php` file.

Options
=======

Configuration options are available in [`config/jhu-zdt-logger.global.php.dist`](https://github.com/jhuet/JhuZdtLoggerModule/blob/master/config/jhu-zdt-logger.global.php.dist) file. If you want to change the default ones, copy it in your `config/autoload` directory, remove the `.dist` extension and edit it.

Options available :

* `logger` : This module will by default create a `Zend\Log\Logger` and add a writer to it. If you already have a logger in your application, you can set it here so it will be used instead of creating a new one. The logger you'll set here has to be available thru the service manager.

Use
===

If you don't already have a logger in your application, you may refere to this one any time you need to via the service manager with the `jhu.zdt_logger` key. Assuming `$sm` is the service maanger, you could call `$sm->get('jhu.zdt_logger')->info('my log');` [to log](http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.1/en/modules/zend.log.overview.html#logging-messages) with the `INFO` priority.

If you already have a logger in your application and you have set it in the options, you at least have to call the logger's module once via the service manager to initialize it. Then you may refere to the logger via your service manager key as it will be the same instance. I'm looking for a way to allow the use of the module without having to make that initialization call. Any help is welcome :)
